# PlaywrightPlayground

Welcome to my PlaywrightPlayground! This repository is a testament to my journey in learning Playwright, and serves as a platform for showcasing my solutions to different test automation practice exercises.
It also demonstrates the various capabilities of Playwright.

While the solutions provided are my own, I believe that there are multiple ways to approach these exercises. 
I welcome any alternative solutions, questions, or general feedback you may have. Feel free to open an issue to start a discussion.

## Guides

As I'm learning Playwright and good testing practices I'll be descrabing it all in this readme. I hope it will serve as a fast start for people wanting to get into automation or as a good quick refresher for me from the future.

### What to know before starting with automation

Presented here is my first Playwright project. I have to note tho that I have previous experience in Programming, Software Developement and Testing. 
I'll try do go in detail into anything that I've learned about Playwright or testing in general and present the best practices in this guide. I will hovever assume that you have some programming knowladge. 
If you're new to programming I've learned a lot from the [Execute Automation channel](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6tu16kXT9Pp3NFZgLbPZXEykeGQwxGSx) and they have C# basics playlist on their channel.
